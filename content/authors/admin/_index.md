My professional journey started with open source, i was a contributor in Fedora(A redhat project) and then during the summer of 2019 and 2020 i got selected for the Highly Competitive Google Summer of Code program to work as a paid summer intern at Fedora(in 2019) to build a Data cross syncronization platform from the Ground up and at Criu(in 2020) for Developing a serializing/de-searlizing container images and transportation algo.

Outside of my work, As a Student i was also a GitHub Campus Expert,I was selected from a pool of 10000+ applicants by GitHub to Build a Tech and hackathon Culture in the western regions of India. I strived to build diverse and inclusive communities to learn tech skills, collaborate on projects, and share experiences. Through this platform, I not only introduced,but also Empowered and Enabled Hundreds of students from Diverse Backgrounds to promising tech domains and Learning. 

I also organized collaborative events like Hackathons and Ideathons in partnership with GitHub in Multiple states Across India. I Enabled the students to Setup out of the standard outdated Indian College Curriculum and to Take their careers into their own Hands.
